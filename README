DNSperf: a tool to track nameserver query latency.

simple solution to the following challenge (in C/C++):

=======
Title: Tracking DNS performance to top sites

Importance: Such performance numbers to top sites can be used as benchmarks
for others to compare to.

Description: Write a c++ program on Linux/BSD(Mac) that periodically sends
DNS queries to the nameservers of the top 10 Alexa domains and stores the
latency values in a mysql table. The frequency of queries should be
specified by the user on command line. The program needs to make sure it
doesnt hit the DNS cache while trying to query for a site and should use a
random string prepended to a domain. E,g. to query foo.bar, make sure to
prepend a random string, e.g. 1234xpto.foo.bar.

Besides the timeseries values, the code needs to keep track in db stats per domain about :
- the average query times
- standard deviation of DNS query times
- number of queries made so far
- time stamp of first query made per domain and last query made

|| General Info ||
++==============++

Based on the options given on the command line, the tool queries all the
nameservers of domains found in the domains database table. Using the MySQL++
library, we retrieve data from the database (domains table) and store latency
measurements, timestamps and statistical calculations to two other (the log
query table and the stats table). The tool runs forever, looping around domains
(outer loop) and the nameservers of each domain (inner loop). 

Prior to the actual querying, if the database does not exist, we create it and
initialize the tables. The domains table contains the given domains (populated
from a static array in the code). The log query table (default name:
dnsperf_queries) keeps the domain, the actual nameserver that we query, the
latency and the timestamp of the query. The stats table is initialized with
NULL values, except for the domains, to ease the value update when the first
domain is done. It contains the domain, the average latency and standard
deviation of all queries the relevant domain up to this point in time, the
total number of queries and the first/last timestamp of querying.


++=======++
|| Usage ||
++=======++

This tool is based on ldns and mysql++-doc examples. Through the cmdline, the
user can customize a various set of parameters: 
- Database specific stuff: the DBMS hostname, the database name, the names of
  the tables (-c, -m, -t, -d, -s).
  WARNING: if -r is used, any existing tables will be dropped.
- the time between query loops to domains (default: 1ms).
- the degree of verbosity (-q, -v or none for standard stats reporting).



 $ ./dnsperf -h
 ./dnsperf <options>
 options: [-h] | [-V] | [-v] [-f <ms>] [-r] [-u <dbuser>] [-p <dbpass]
          [-c <dbhostname>] [-m <dbname>] [-t <logtable>] [-d <domaintable>]
          [-s <stattable>]

   -h			  print this help and exit
   -V			  print version and exit

   -q			  supress stat output
   -v			  verbose output
   -f <time>		  time to wait after each loop (in ms)

   Database Specific (MySQL)
   -r			  re-initialize database (WARNING: all existing data is lost)
   -u <user>		  user to connect to database (default: root)
   -p <pass>		  pass to connect to database (default: <empty>)
   -c <hostname>	  hostname that MySQL is running (default: localhost)
   -m <dbname>		  MySQL database name (default: dnsperf_data)
                            if it doesn't exist, we create it, implies -r
   -t <table>		  table name for logging queries (default: dnsperf_queries)
   -d <table>		  table name for top level domains (default: dnsperf_domains)
   -s <table>		  table name for stats (default: dnsperf_stattable)

|| Notes ||
++=======++

We use the LDNS library to perform DNS queries. We first build a resolver using
the host machine as a referece (meaning we use /etc/resolv.conf) to obtain all
the nameservers that serve a specific domain. We then push each one of these
nameservers to a resolver through which we perform the actual query of a random
domain. Finally, we destroy the resolver and start all over again.

We abuse the database a bit, keeping timestamps for every query we do. This is
a workaround for doing as less queries as possible. We also use MySQL to
calculate AVG, STDDEV and the timestamp of the first/last query.

We get latency measurements using gettimeofday. We store micro-seconds to the
database, but print out milliseconds. 

Issues and known bugs:
- We don't fail when we can't reach a nameserver (had several issues with
qq.com). Instead, we just skip updating the database, so there's no noise in
the above calculations.
- When specifying a table via the cmdline to act (say) as the log query table,
  if the table exists but has got a different schema, we fail :S.
- There are some memory leaks, probably due to improper LDNS/MySQL++ handling.
  Must investigate further.

Tested with:
- g++ version 4.4 (4.4.5), 4.6 (4.6.3)
- libmysql++ 3.0.9, 3.1.0
- libldns 1.6.6, 1.6.13

 a. Really quiet (silently populating the database):
   $ ./dnsperf -q
    Starting to loop...
    Iteration 1 done, sleeping for 1ms. 
    ...

 b. Re-initializing/creating the database and sleeping for 1 second between each outer loop:
   $ ./dnsperf -r -q -f 1000
    Dropping existing tables...
    Reinitialized database successfully.
    Starting to loop...
    Iteration 1 done, sleeping for 1000ms.
